- **Flexible LLM Support**: Easily select from a wide range of powerful models from providers like **Google (Gemini)** and **Groq (Llama, Gemma, etc.)**.

- **Persistent Session History**: Conversations are saved per session ID, allowing you to pick up where you left off.

- **Real-time Streaming**: Responses are streamed token-by-token for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
